<p>The Welcome Recipe was created to help site owners and site architects that are relatively new to Backdrop get a jump start on understanding the power of Backdrop and what it can do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We've enabled and added some features to this site that will help you get started and learn more about how Backdrop CMS works.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>This module is intended to work on a relatively fresh Backdrop site with mostly default settings and content.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Specifically, here is a list of the changes that this module has made to your site:</p>

<ol>
	<li>We create a new "About" page, place it in the main menu along with a few sub-menu items. If you already had an About page, we unpublished it. You can still find the old version, if there was one,&nbsp;in the list of content for the site -&nbsp;<em>/admin/content</em>.</li>
	<li>We generate over 20 pieces of content (nodes). The content generated is intended to help you better envision how Backdrop CMS can be used to build a website and to explain some of the features, while linking you to additional resources where you can learn more.</li>
	<li>In addition to generating additional new content, this module has modified the default content in default post and default page provided by Backdrop core. The content changes are intended to add useful information and context for someone using Backdrop CMS for the first time.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Enables the Book module (in core) and creates the User Manual book. The User Manual has general information about Backdrop, but can also be customized and used a site specific user manual for this specific site.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Installs and enables&nbsp;the <a href="https://backdropcms.org/project/content_view_access">Content View Access</a> module. The Content View Access module is a contrib module that allows us to easily set access permissions for specific content types. We are using this module to make Book pages only accessible to authenticated users.</li>
	<li>Installs and enables the <a href="https://backdropcms.org/project/mini_layouts">Mini Layouts</a> module. The Mini Layouts module is a contrib module that allows us to create a layout within a layout. We are using this module to create a special "footer" layout that we can use throughout the site. Without the this special Footer mini layout, we would have to place footer blocks into each layout individually and edit them in multiple places. With this module enabled, we can create one mini layout and manage it in one place, but use it in many places.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>We added a Contact Info block to the footer that can be modified and reused on this site or deleted.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>We added a Recent Content view to the footer to help showcase how the Views module (in core)&nbsp;works and what you can do with it.</li>
	<li>Adds a hero image on the front page and makes it a little larger than it would be by default in the Basis theme. It also changes the message in the front page hero image.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>We add a "profile" field to user accounts and populate that field for the #1 user = admin.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>We add a Tags view and place it in the right sidebar of every post or tag taxonomy page. This provides a quick way to find related content on the site.</li>
</ol>
